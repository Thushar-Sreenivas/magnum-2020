                                <h3>Company Bio</h3>
<p>Founded in 2014, Nuritas™ is revolutionizing the discovery of novel, natural and scientifically proven active ingredients that can manage and improve human health. The company’s disruptive computational approach to discovery uses artificial intelligence, deep learning and genomics to rapidly and efficiently predict and then provide access to the most health-benefitting components hidden within food, called peptides.</p>
<p>Nuritas™ has received global recognition for the impact its innovative technology will have on the future of food and health. This includes winning the overall Innovation Award at the Forbes Reinventing America Summit in 2015, the Nutrition Capital Network Venture competition in October 2016 and support from EU Horizon 2020 in 2016 for a peptide that carries the potential to prevent prediabetic patients from developing diabetes.</p>
<p>We have been named among the top 21 most innovative companies alongside industry giants such as Uber, notably being the only EU company listed.</p>
<p>We received the top Innovation Award at the Forbes Reinventing America AgTech Summit in 2015 where we were honoured for our innovative work to help solve global food and wellness challenges. We were again the only EU company represented.</p>
<p>A further prestigious honour that Nuritas™ has received was our selection as 1 of the 10 most ground-breaking technologies in Europe in the EU SME Assembly TEDx event “Made in Europe”.</p>
<p>We have been named as 1 of the top 10 firms at the forefront of anti-aging.</p>
<p>We were named among the top 10 AI leaders in a list that also featured the huge multinationals IBM and Intel (through its acquisition of Movidius).</p>
<p>In January 2018, we were named as one of the top European start-ups to watch in 2018 and among Europe’s top Health and Medtech Start-ups.</p>
<p>We have been described by one major Silicon Valley investor and early investor in Facebook and Dropbox as having the potential to “be as big or even bigger than Facebook or Dropbox.”</p>
<p>In December 2017, we announced our US$20M Series A Funding led by Chicago-based Cultivian Sandbox Ventures. This brings the total invested to date to approximately US$30 million, including early funding from U2’s Bono and The Edge, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, Singapore-based VisVires New Protein and angel investor Ali Partovi.</p>

DEEP is a meditative VR game controlled by breathing. Players don a Virtual Reality headset and a custom DEEP controller to explore a beautiful and mysterious underwater world. Allow the game to sweep you into its relaxing embrace as it teaches you yogic breathing techniques that can alleviate stress, anxiety, and mild depression.
